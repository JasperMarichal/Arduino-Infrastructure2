About Me
Hey there! I'm Jasper, and this is the readme file for my Assessment Portfolio in Term 4 of the 2022-2023 course. I'm excited to share my progress and showcase the work I've done throughout the term. Let's dive in!

Repository Structure
To effectively showcase my work, I organized my repositroy in a structrued manner. This is the structure I followed: 
- /Assignments Week1
  - Assignment1
  - Assignment2
  - ...
- /Demos Week2
  - Demo1
  - Demo2
  - ...
- /Extras
- /libraries
  - lib1
  - lib2
  - ...
- /Project Week 1
- ...
- /Final Project

I made a folder for every weeks assignemnts and demos. Projects and libraries I kept seperate because they are more important.

Project One-Armed bandit
Here's a summary of what I have accomplished in the One-Armed Bandit project:

1. Implemented the basic functionality of the game, allowing the player to choose the number of displays and bet money.
2. Generated random symbols by pressing a button and displayed them on the LED displays.
3. Added a victory sound effect and adjusted the win amount based on the number of displays used.
4. Handled cases where the player runs out of money or reaches the maximum amount, displaying appropriate messages.
5. Implemented the appearance features, such as displaying the remaining coins and permanently showing the amount when the player has 4 or fewer coins.
6. Utilized dynamic memory (HEAP) to track slotsActive and the slotNumbers.
7. Incorporated the ability to view the game progress in the serial monitor at the end of the game, including the total time and number of wins.
8. t the start, creating an engaging user experience.
Added a sound effect at the end of the game to provide a sense of closure.
9. Utilized the value of the potentiometer as the seed for the random generator, ensuring random symbol generation.
Extensions

1. The player can increase or decrease the number of displays by pressing the left button, allowing for more dynamic gameplay.
2. Instead of using numbers, I created 10 clearly distinguishable symbols to display on the LED displays, enhancing the visual appeal of the game.
3. Implemented the ability for the player to wager a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4 coins per turn, displayed using the 4 dots on the LED display. The win amount is adjusted accordingly.


Conclusion
I'm thrilled with the progress I've made in developing the One-Armed Bandit project. I have successfully fulfilled all the required specifications, incorporated extensions to enhance the gameplay, and ensured a smooth user experience. I am confident in my ability to discuss and explain my work during the oral exam.

Thank you for taking the time to review my accomplishments in the One-Armed Bandit project.
